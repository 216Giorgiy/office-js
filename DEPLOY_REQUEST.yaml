# First, specify the TARGET BRANCH for your change. Guidelines:
# If you are pushing a copy of ____
#    * RELEASE files that are already on the public CDN
#         ==> choose "release"
#    * RELEASE files that are on EDOG but *NOT* the public CDN yet
#         ==> choose "release-next"
#    * BETA files that are already on the public CDN
#         ==> choose "beta"
#    * BETA files that are on EDOG but *NOT* the public CDN yet
#         ==> choose "beta-next"

targetBranch: beta-next



# Now specify the NAME OF THE BRANCH YOU WANT TO COPY THE FILES FROM.
#    For example "__adhoc--beta-next--16.0.8918.5450--2018-01-18--8.52am"

from: __adhoc--beta-next--16.0.9028.5450--2018-01-30--1.13pm



# Would you like to automatically delete the adhoc branch on completion?
#    (Generally yes -- there is nothing left to do with the branch, it's only in the way)
